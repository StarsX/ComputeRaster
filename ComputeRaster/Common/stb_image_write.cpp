   writes out PNG/BMP/TGA/JPEG/HDR images to C stdio - Sean Barrett 2010-2015

   Before #including,

       #define STB_IMAGE_WRITE_IMPLEMENTATION

   in the file that you want to have the implementation.

   Will probably not work correctly with strict-aliasing optimizations.

ABOUT:

   This header file is a library for writing images to C stdio or a callback.

   The PNG output is not optimal; it is 20-50% larger than the file
   written by a decent optimizing implementation; though providing a custom
   zlib compress function (see STBIW_ZLIB_COMPRESS) can mitigate that.
   This library is designed for source code compactness and simplicity,
   not optimal image file size or run-time performance.

BUILDING:

   You can #define STBIW_ASSERT(x) before the #include to avoid using assert.h.
   You can #define STBIW_MALLOC(), STBIW_REALLOC(), and STBIW_FREE() to replace
   malloc,realloc,free.
   You can #define STBIW_MEMMOVE() to replace memmove()
   You can #define STBIW_ZLIB_COMPRESS to use a custom zlib-style compress function
   for PNG compression (instead of the builtin one), it must have the following signature:
   unsigned char * my_compress(unsigned char *data, int data_len, int *out_len, int quality);
   The returned data will be freed with STBIW_FREE() (free() by default),
   so it must be heap allocated with STBIW_MALLOC() (malloc() by default),

UNICODE:

   If compiling for Windows and you wish to use Unicode filenames, compile
   with
       #define STBIW_WINDOWS_UTF8
   and pass utf8-encoded filenames. Call stbiw_convert_wchar_to_utf8 to convert
   Windows wchar_t filenames to utf8.

USAGE:

   There are five functions, one for each image file format:

     int stbi_write_png(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data, int stride_in_bytes);
     int stbi_write_bmp(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data);
     int stbi_write_tga(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data);
     int stbi_write_jpg(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const void *data, int quality);
     int stbi_write_hdr(char const *filename, int w, int h, int comp, const float *data);

     void stbi_flip_vertically_on_write(int flag); // flag is non-zero to flip data vertically

   There are also five equivalent functions that use an arbitrary write function. You are
   expected to open/close your file-equivalent before and after calling these:

     int stbi_write_png_to_func(stbi_write_func *func, void *context, int w, int h, int comp, const void  *data, int stride_in_bytes);
     int stbi_write_bmp_to_func(stbi_write_func *func, void *context, int w, int h, int comp, const void  *data);
     int stbi_write_tga_to_func(stbi_write_func *func, void *context, int w, int h, int comp, const void  *data);
     int stbi_write_hdr_to_func(stbi_write_func *func, void *context, int w, int h, int comp, const float *data);
     int stbi_write_jpg_to_func(stbi_write_func *func, void *context, int x, int y, int comp, const void *data, int quality);

   where the callback is:
      void stbi_write_func(void *context, void *data, int size);

   You can configure it with these global variables:
      int stbi_write_tga_with_rle;             // defaults to true; set to 0 to disable RLE
      int stbi_write_png_compression_level;    // defaults to 8; set to higher for more compression
      int stbi_write_force_png_filter;         // defaults to -1; set to 0..5 to force a filter mode


   You can define STBI_WRITE_NO_STDIO to disable the file variant of these
   functions, so the library will not use stdio.h at all. However, this will
   also disable HDR writing, because it requires stdio for formatted output.

   Each function returns 0 on failure and non-0 on success.

   The functions create an image file defined by the parameters. The image
   is a rectangle of pixels stored from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
   Each pixel contains 'comp' channels of data stored interleaved with 8-bits
   per channel, in the following order: 1=Y, 2=YA, 3=RGB, 4=RGBA. (Y is
   monochrome color.) The rectangle is 'w' pixels wide and 'h' pixels tall.
   The *data pointer points to the first byte of the top-left-most pixel.
   For PNG, "stride_in_bytes" is the distance in bytes from the first byte of
   a row of pixels to the first byte of the next row of pixels.

   PNG creates output files with the same number of components as the input.
   The BMP format expands Y to RGB in the file format and does not
   output alpha.

   PNG supports writing rectangles of data even when the bytes storing rows of
   data are not consecutive in memory (e.g. sub-rectangles of a larger image),
   by supplying the stride between the beginning of adjacent rows. The other
   formats do not. (Thus you cannot write a native-format BMP through the BMP
   writer, both because it is in BGR order and because it may have padding
   at the end of the line.)

   PNG allows you to set the deflate compression level by setting the global
   variable 'stbi_write_png_compression_level' (it defaults to 8).

   HDR expects linear float data. Since the format is always 32-bit rgb(e)
   data, alpha (if provided) is discarded, and for monochrome data it is
   replicated across all three channels.

   TGA supports RLE or non-RLE compressed data. To use non-RLE-compressed
   data, set the global variable 'stbi_write_tga_with_rle' to 0.

   JPEG does ignore alpha channels in input data; quality is between 1 and 100.
   Higher quality looks better but results in a bigger image.
   JPEG baseline (no JPEG progressive).
